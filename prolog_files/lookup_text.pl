% Take a text and tokenize it with ET, the efficient tokenizer 
% from Michael A. Covington.
% Eliminate everything that is not a word. The tokenizer returns 
% a list of letters of each word. This list needs to be changed into an
% atom. Before going on, remove all duplicates to reduce the number
% of words. Then, check which atoms are in WordNet and print out the answer.
