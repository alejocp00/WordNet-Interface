% Opens the wn_s.pl file for input, makes some changes to the order of the 
% arguments to improve the efficiency and gives out a new file wn_s_new.pl.
%
% improve_file
% Open wn_s.pl, to read from it.
% Open a new file to write the new predicates in it. 
% Call improve_file/2 to make the changes. Close the two Streams.

% improve_file(+InStream,-OutStream)
% Read a predicate from the stream. Change the order of its arguments.
% To improve indexing the word should be the first argument.
% Make sure, that the word is in apostrophes. Also, apostrophes in the word 
% have to be written twice, like in the original file.
% Therefore take the ASCII list of the word and check if it has apostrophes
% with test_ap/2. If no, just write out the Word.
% If yes, put an extra apostrophe in the word with put_ap/2.
% Convert the ASCII list with the extra apostrophe into an atom.
% Finally, write out the other arguments of the predicate.
% Call improve_file/2 recursively to convert all other s predicates.
