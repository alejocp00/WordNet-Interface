% Operator(+Word,-List)
% Depending on the operator requested, call the predicate all_one/4 or all_two/4
% with the third argument instantiated to the predicate that needs to be
% consulted later. Use n as the fourth argument as the category for
% meronyms and holonyms is always n.
% The category argument needs to be introduced, as the predicates
% all_one/4 and all_two/4 will be reused in other files.

% Given a noun, find the list of groups that the word is a member of.
