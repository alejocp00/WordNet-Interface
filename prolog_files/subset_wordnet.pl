% subset_wordnet(+Number)
% Call subset_wn_s to make a subset of the file wn_s.pl which has an amount of words equal to
% the argument Number. Subset_wn_s/2 also returns an IDList of all the words of the subset.
% Then, call subset to convert all files of WordNet.
% The first argument of the predicate subset stores the number of arguments that a predicate
% has in each file to indentify which procedure is needed.
% Exceptions: The predicate g of the file wn_g.pl has two arguments, but gets the argument number
% 1 as its structure doesn't match with the other 2-place predicates.

% subset_two_args(+Args,+Filename,+Pred,+IDList)
% The predicate takes four arguments, one to store the Number of Arguments Args that each
% predicate in the file has, the Filename itself, then the predicate name Pred that is 
% described in the file and finally the IDList of the words that should be in the subset 
% of the files.
% First open the file to read from it. Then, open a new file to write in it.
% The name of the new file should have the following structure: wn_PREDICATENAME_subset.pl.
% Call make_subset/4 and close the InStream and OutStream.

					atom_chars(Pred,List),

					atom_chars(X,EndList),

					make_subset(Args,InStream,OutStream,IDList),

% make_subset(+Args,+Instream,-OutStream,+IDList)
% The first argument of make_subset tells us how many arguments a predicate
% in the file has. According to that, we modify the algorithm, so that
% we can check whether an ID Number is in the IDList or not.
% If the whole file was read and we are at the end of the InStream, succeed.
% Else read the first line of the file which is a predicate structure
% to get the arguments that are the ID Numbers. Use the univ operator.
% Then check whether one of the ID Numbers is in the IDList.
% If yes, write the predicate structure in the new file and call
% make_stream recursivly. Else call make_subset. In that case the predicate 
% structure won't be in the new file.
% Make sure that no apostrophes get lost in the wn_g.pl file!!!
